Doctoral research student in linguistics at Humboldt University in Berlin and Leibniz-Zentrum Allgemeine Sprachwissenschaft.

My PhD project looks into the morphosyntactic interactions in language mixing, explores the possibilities and restrictions, and extends them to the understanding of universal grammar in general. The project focuses on nominal phases and involves three languages: Cantonese, Japanese and English. 

My research interests are: morphosyntax, universal grammar, sociolinguistics, Cantonese, crosslinguistic variation, language mixing, and language contact phenomena.
